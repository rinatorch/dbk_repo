        <h2><b>Tracking community COVID-19 spread at the University of Maryland</b></h2>
              <p class="timeheader"> With more and more vaccines trickling in, the state of Maryland had finally begun to recover from a winter surge of COVID-19. Meanwhile, a series of COVID-19 clusters and outbreaks started cropping up in University of Maryland community.</p>
        <p class="timeheader"> The first sign of an outbreak came in the second week of school in LaPlata Hall. Two weeks later, the university announced further restrictions. Days later the university began to sequester in place. And now, some classes are back in-person and limitations are lifted.</p>
        <p class="timeheader"> Here’s a look at what led the campus to a sequester-in-place and what metrics pulled the community out of it in a short, unprecednted month. </p>

                        When students returned to the University of Maryland for the first day of classes on Jan. 25, the seven-day state positivity rate was hovering at about 6.6%. Students were required to undergo a COVID-19 test before they moved into their dorms or apartments, and another one once they arrived.</p>
                    <p> On Jan. 25, a single positive test was reported through campus testing.
                        Testing was set to be different this semester. Unlike in the fall, the administration required that students undergo testing once every two weeks. Failure to do so could result in suspension. But in the short term, non-compliance with the daily symptom check and campus testing meant an onslaught of automated emails.

                        The university implemented “Enhanced Safety Precautions” on LaPlata Hall due to the sudden increase in cases. Residents were faced with a decision: they could restrict their activities on campus for 10 days or return home. They had less than three hours to make their decision.
                    </p>
                    <p> Residents who chose to remain on campus were barred from visiting RecWell facilities, the Stamp Student Union, and in-person classes, which were set to begin on the next business day.
                        Students living in the hall were ordered to undergo testing the next day.
                    </p>
                    <p> In the days that followed, LaPlata residents were allotted a one-hour window to pick up each meal from the dining hall from a designated station.

Under the order, students in dorms university Greek Life housing were not allowed to leave for any inessential activities. All RecWell facilities, including Eppley, closed their doors for a week.

                        Quarantine and isolation occupancy started declining in the days that followed the directive. By Feb. 27, there were 128 occupants. That’s when the university lifted the sequester-in-place order. Monday and indoor gathering restrictions loosened.

                    <p> TAs the month drew to a close, the university announced that on March 1, in-person classes would resume. Indoor gathering restrictions were dramatically loosened. Now, 25-person outdoor gatherings were permitted, as were 10-person indoor gatherings.
